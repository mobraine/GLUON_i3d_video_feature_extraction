All the relevant codes are in the Feat_extract_I3D folder. The rest are irrelevant to extract features.

In Feat_extract_I3D folder, feature_extract.py is the one that does the job, and I recommend you look at the code provided here https://cv.gluon.ai/build/examples_action_recognition/feat_custom.html about how to use this program. makeVideosTXT is used to generate the text file, videos.txt needed for executing the program, which is also indicated in the above link. It took me a lot of time and pain to configure the environment, so good luck with that!
